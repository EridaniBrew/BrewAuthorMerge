    <h1>Caveats</h1>

    <h2>Code Changes</h2>
    No attempt is made to merge changes to the large code section in front of the tiddlers, or the code section after the tiddlers. I assume people are not writing their 
    own sections of code? If so, send me a copy of what you do and I can look at doing this merge. Modifying this code seems like a dangerous activity,
    but there could be people doing it. Perhaps there are simple aadjustments to be made.
    
    <h2>Deleted ACP Tiddlers</h2>

    If a tiddler is part of (for example) ACP 12.1, and the 12.2 release has removed this tiddler, the 12.1 tiddler will be merged back in.
    <p/>
    Similarly, if an ACP menu item is removed from the updated system the merge operation will put it back in. It can't tell the difference between
    a Customized entry and outdated ACP menu entry.


    <h2>Backing Up before Merging</h2>
    <img src="images/Acc15.gif" style="float:left; padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px" />
    As described in <a href="Workflow.html">Workflow</a> you really need to back up the newly installed author.html and index.asp files before you start 
    messing with them using BAM (or any other tool).
    There is a "small chance" that BAM may create a problem which is difficult to recover from. 

    <h2>Not an Editor</h2>
    BAM does not provide any editing capability of the tiddlers or the menu structure. It is intended only to merge the files. 
    Subsequent editing can be done in the ACP editing system as usual, or in some other editor as desired.
