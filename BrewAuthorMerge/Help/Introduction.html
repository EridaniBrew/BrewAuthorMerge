    <h2>ACP Web Page Customization Process</h2>

    ACP provides a very nifty web page interface to allow users to run plans and do various tasks within ACP. 
    This web page is coded in the file <em>Doc Root/author.html</em>. The ACP Authoring environment allows
    users to modify this file, adding capabilities in the form of modified or new tiddlers. 
    You can also rearrange the existing menu entries, or add new menu entries for your new tiddlers. This is a very powerful
    capability.
    <p/>
    However: Each time ACP is updated to the next release, the author.html file update is a bit of a pain.<p/>
    
    As part of the ACP update process the current author.html file (containing hours of your elegant customizations) 
    is copied to a backup name (something like <em>Doc Root/author-backups/author.bk-20150923_170957.html.</em>). 
    I will refer to this file as the <b>Customized file</b>, since it contains your valuable customization changes.
    The updater then installs a brand new clean author.html file with whatever 
    cool updates have been made by Bob. I will refer to this file as the <b>ACP file</b>.

    <p/>You now have the task of re-applying your changes from the Customization file into the new author.html.<p/>

    <p/>
    ACP provides a couple of tools for extracting modified tiddlers from your author.html file and applying them to the new 
    file. However, a) 
    they only apply to the tiddlers, and b) they need to be run from a command shell or a batch file. 
    I have not had much success using these tools.
    <p/>
    <p />
    The update process used by some ACP users involves using a diff tool (I now use DiffMerge as shown here). The process entails two updates, 
    one for the tiddler definitions and 
    one for the Main Menu structure. It works, but I tend to mess things up every so often. In addition, it involves a separate manual 
    backup of the Main Menu structure from within the authoring tool.
    <p /></div>
    <h2>Enter BAM</h2>   
    So, I took a shot at a tool to do the merging for me. BAM (short for BrewAuthorMerge) is probably simplistic; it is hard to determine in all cases whether
    a piece of the old file should migrate to the new version. For my observatory, my changes to author.html are pretty straightforward; I add or modify a few tiddlers,
    and add a couple of menu items. I expect that other ACP users may have significantly more complex changes. 
    Check the <a href="Features.html">Features/Caveats</a> page for specifics.
    <p/>
    I hope people will give BAM a try, if for no other reason than to help me find issues or things that can be added
    (the typical Microsoft Beta Test). If you find issues with the tool, please drop me an email. 
    Include a screenshot of the problem, and a copy of the two html files you were using so I can debug the issue.<p />

    In fact, I am interested in collecting customized author.html files in general. If you are willing, please email me a copy of your modified author.html 
    file so I can add it to my test bank.
