    This section describes my expected steps to perform the merge of a backup author file (containing my modifications) with a freshly installed 
    ACP author.html.
    <p/>
    You may well come up with a different process, this is just my concept.
    <ul >
        <li><h2>Back Up Files</h2>
            <img src="images/JoeBtfsplk.png" style="float:right; padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 20px" />
        Back up / rename the following files:<p/>
            <ul>
                <li><b>author.html</b>. The ACP file. This is typically located at DocRoot, something like <em>C:\Users\Public\Documents\ACP Web Data\Doc Root</em>. I name mine 
            authorOrig.html; it is the original author file from ACP.</li>
                <li><b>index.asp</b>. This is also located at DocRoot. Copy index.asp to indexOrig.asp. Don't delete the index.asp file; it will be replaced later.</li>
                <li><b>backup author.html</b>. The Customized file. This is typically located at <em>DocRoot/author-backup</em> with a name like author.bk-20160517_190644.html,
            based on the date the file was saved by ACP. <p/>
            OK, you shouldn't really need to back this one up since we will not be modifying it. I am the reincarnation of Joe Btfsplk, so I have to be extra careful.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><h2>Run BAM</h2>
        Run the BAM tool, and follow these steps. <p/>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Click the "Customized File ..." button. Use the file dialog to select the Customized file. This is your backed up author file 
            (like author.bk-20160517_190644.html) containing your modifications. After selection, you should see the file name in the text below the button.<p /></li>
            <li>Similarly, use the "New (ACP) ..." button to select your authorOrig.html file.<p /></li>
            <li>Click the "Go" button to perform the merge. The merged tiddlers will be filled in. <p /></li>
            <li><em>Optionally</em>, click on the various tiddlers to check what has happened. Click the Main Menu tiddler to review changes in the menu.<p /></li>
            <li>Use File/Save Updated File to save your new author file. Save it back into DocRoot for the next step.<p /></li>
        </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Run ACP in Authoring Mode</h2>
            Use Chrome (or whatever you use for authoring) to bring up the ACP web page. It will show the unchanged ACP menus; none of
            your changes are implemented yet. <p/>

            Go into Authoring mode. Now you should see the merged menu and tiddler modifications. Check that the menus look OK, maybe check a few tiddlers.<p/>

            Click the Save to Web button at the upper right. This will use your merged author file to create a replacement index.asp (you did back up the original, right?).<p/>

            Go back into the normal ACP web page. You should now see your modifications in all their glory.
        </li>
</ul>
